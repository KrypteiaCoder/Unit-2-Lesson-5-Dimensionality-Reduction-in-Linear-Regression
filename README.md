The trick to successful PLSR is to select the right number of components to keep. Use the cell below to create new partial least square regressions with different numbers of components, then see how those changes affect the ability of your models to reproduce the predicted Y values as well as the regular linear regression. Typically, you would choose your components based on the number that gives the most consistent performance between training and test datasets.
